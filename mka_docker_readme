## Simulation of grid trading (more orders the same coins in more RSI values)

A directory containing the definition of containers in docker-compose that mimic the grid.
They have a common config.js - where you set up, for example, 10 selected currencies.
Set up an account for trading and set a maximum percentage for trading.
Once started, the machines will trade against one account, but they will each buy
with a different RSI, use DCA and collect the profit back into the account.
